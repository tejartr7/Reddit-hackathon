# Queen Rule  

**Queen Rule** is a strategic puzzle game inspired by the classic N-Queens problem. The objective is to place queens on a chessboard in such a way that no two queens threaten each other. The game progressively increases in difficulty with 4 challenging rounds, and players must carefully strategize as mistakes are limited per round:  

- **Round 1**: 4x4 board – You can make up to **3 mistakes**.  
- **Round 2**: 6x6 board – You can make up to **4 mistakes**.  
- **Round 3**: 8x8 board – You can make up to **5 mistakes**.  
- **Round 4**: 10x10 board – You can make up to **5 mistakes**.  

This project leverages **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**, and the **Reddit Developer Platform (Devvit)** to create an interactive game playable directly on Reddit.

## 🎮 About the Game  
**Queen Rule** combines logic, strategy, and fun. Players must carefully place queens on the board, ensuring they do not threaten each other horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Progress through rounds with increasing board sizes and limited mistakes allowed. Each error takes you closer to a game over, so plan your moves wisely!
